    <div id="Day1">
      <h4>Day 1</h4>
        <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel <br>Tower (check out the beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la</em><br><em>Seine.</em></p>

    <div id="Day2">
      <h4>Day 2</h4>
        <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des champs Elysees.</em> Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.</p>
        <p>after we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiul places! We went to <em>Notre Dame.</em> We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre.</em></p>

    <div id="Day3">
      <h4>Day 3</h4>
        <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
